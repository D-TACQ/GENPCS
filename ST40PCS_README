README for ST40PCS
# There are 3 runtime configs:
acq : acq hardware test, NO SIMULINK   "Clyde"
mod : model test, NO hardware, with SIMULINK "Rhone"
pcs : acq+mod, the final product, with ACQ and SIMULINK  "Thames"
nul : no hardware, no model : tests the model compile

# There are 2 configurations
sngl : single box
dual : dual box

# total 6 executables
acq-sngl, acq-dual
mod-sngl, mod-dual	# in practise, maybe there's only ONE mod
pcs-sngl, pcs-dual

# ACQ is only available when ACQ box is present, otherwise use ACQ_stub
# the MODEL is only available on a machine with a valid Simulink license,
# otherwise use ST40PCS_stub

# We also propose two boxes. There's a single box test and a dual box test
# For simplicity, both boxes are considered identical, with
# 128AI, 32AO, 32DIO
# Physically, the boxes may have
# Box 1 : 128AI, 32 DIO
# Box 2 :  64AI, 32 AO, 32DIO
# However, if they both fake the missing functions, then the boxes are 
# interchangeable, and we only need two types of test
# sngl : SiNGLe box
# dual : DUAL box
# Ideally, each box has some AI and some AO, then we can run a "real" external 
# test using a scope. 

# A single module linux_rt.c takes care of the real time issues and common 
# "User Interface".
# A single module acq_shim.c takes care of interfacing to the acq.
